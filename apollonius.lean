# Generalized Apollonius Problem: Formal Enumerative Proof Skeleton

We formalize the enumerative count of circles tangent to prescribed
conditions in the moduli space `ùìú`. The Chow ring is modelled by a quotient
`‚Ñ§[h]/(h^3 - 2*h)`.

We then compute the intersection product:

  (3h^2 - h^3) * (2h - 2h^2) * (12h^3 - 20h^2).

This collapses to a multiple of `h`, and the coefficient is the enumerative count.

instance : Add Chow where

instance : Neg Chow where
  neg a := ‚ü®-a.coeff.1, -a.coeff.2‚ü©

-- Zero, One
instance : Zero Chow where zero := ‚ü®0,0‚ü©
instance : One Chow where one := ‚ü®1,0‚ü©

instance : Mul Chow where
  mul a b :=
    let (a0,a1) := a.coeff
    let (b0,b1) := b.coeff
    -- expand (a0 + a1*h)(b0 + b1*h) = a0*b0 + (a0*b1+a1*b0)*h + a1*b1*h^2
    let c0 := a0*b0
    let c1 := a0*b1 + a1*b0
    let c2 := a1*b1
    -- Now reduce using h^2 is just a symbol and h^3=2h => h^2*h = 2h
    -- But we only keep degree ‚â§2; represent as ‚ü®c0, c1‚ü© + c2*(h^2).
    -- For simplicity, keep h^2 separate: we'll reduce h^2 next.
    -- Since h^2 is independent, we embed it by rewriting h^2 =? 
    -- Simplify: treat basis {1,h,h^2}, impose h^3=2h.
    -- Do multiplication properly below.
    ‚ü®c0, c1‚ü© + ‚ü®0,0‚ü©  -- placeholder, expand fully later

-- TODO: full ring instance with explicit reduction (can be worked out).

-- Example: building the expression (3h^2 - h^3)(2h - 2h^2)(12h^3 - 20h^2).
-- For now, we symbolically encode and manually reduce.
