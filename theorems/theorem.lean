  Sample Theorem: Chow Ring Intersection Relation h^3 = 2h
  -------------------------------------------------------

  We use a typeclass to encode the Chow ring and define the 
  key relation related to enumerative geometry.

-- We abstract the ring structure for intersection classes
class ChowRing (α : Type) :=
(add : α → α → α)
(zero : α)
(mul : α → α → α)
(one : α)
-- simplify notation
(infixl:65 " + " => add)
(infixl:70 " * " => mul)

-- Divisor class h in Chow ring
variable {R : Type} [ChowRing R]

variable (h : R)

-- The key relation from enumerative geometry
axiom chow_relation : h * h * h = (two : R) * h

-- We'll declare two as a constant for readability
variable (two : R)

-- Application to the generalized Apollonius problem would go here.
